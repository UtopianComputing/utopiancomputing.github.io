Utopian Computing is a technological think-tank focussed on the idea of the ideal computer system.

The internet is awash with news sites, how-to sites and blogs with tips and tricks, documentation and tutorials on how to use products that already exist to create great tech solutions.

Additionally, here's a great deal of marketing input into trying to set the agenda for these sites and the content they deliver, the advice they give and the implementations you choose.

Utopian Computing is a layer above that. Utopian Computing is a project with the aim of clearly defining what an ideal computer system would look like. This vision intends to take into account the present-day reality, but to guide from it rather than be constrained by it.

What should you be building? How should you be building it? What does perfect look like? Utopian Computing aims to answer some of these questions based on original research, meta-studies and collation of ideas in a way that's independent of anyone trying to sell you something.

Take a breath of fresh air. See the future.
