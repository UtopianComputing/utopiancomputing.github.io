    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At RubyConf Brasil yesterday I presented to Ruby developers these arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operations and systems engineering are equally important to the success of a software project as the actual development of the application itself.</li>
<li>DevOps is a simple concept: development and operations working together towards a common goal.</li>
<li>Devs and sysadmins provide each other with value and mutual respect and collaboration help everyone. For developers this means respect and learn from good sysadmins.</li>
<li>Abstractions are as important in operations as they are in code for productivity and containment of complexity.</li>
<li>Automation and testing of your architecture are vital.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once the video of the presentation is released, I&rsquo;ll follow up with a post here.</p>

<p>At the end of my presentation I explained that 45 minutes is not enough time to achieve the stated goal of the presentation, which was to tell you how to do ops. IT operations is a huge subject, and cannot be solved in a single presentation.</p>

<p>At this point, it was time to announce the launch of Utopian Computing and its mission. Utopian Computing is an attempt to define what an ideal operating environment looks like and define the shortest route to reach it. You can <a href="http://UtopianComputing.github.io/about">read more about what we&rsquo;re about</a> and sign up to the mailing list here to receive the lastest news.</p>

<p>Later today I&rsquo;ll be sending out my presentation slides and a whole bunch of links for further reading around the subjects I talked about. Sign up to the mailing list to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

<p>Did you see the presentation? Did you enjoy it, or were you bored? Do you have questions, arguments or ideas? Comment below!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In two weeks, Ben Langfeld will present at <a href="http://www.rubyconf.com.br/">RubyConf Brasil</a> for the third time. &ldquo;Quality software engineering for your data center&rdquo; is up at 13:15 on 28th August 2014 at the Frei Caneca Theatre, SÃ£o Paulo.</p>

<p>DevOps is the melding of minds between the development/engineering and operations communities to form a super-discipline with the best of the experience of both sides as a force for stability, flexibility, efficiency and agility in the management of large-scale application or service deployments. DevOps is about automating out day-to-day monotony, and then going further to bridge many of the things operations people are used to doing manually with the best-practices developed on the other side of the fence, particularly around automated testing and agility.</p>

<p>Go! But wait a minute! That&rsquo;s not enough for everyone to know what they should be doing, you say. You&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not. There is a wealth of information on specific DevOps issues on the internet, and some good introductory material, but few comprehensive, opinionated overviews of what you <em>should</em> do. This talk will solve that problem and have you 100% ready to embark on or fix-up your DevOps journey to blissful nights sleep while rocking regular new features for your users.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll talk Puppet &amp; Chef, testing and turbulence, robots and thermo-nuclear weapons. If you&rsquo;ve just started with DevOps and need to know what you need to know, or have been muddling for a little while with some Puppets but the show always turns into a fight, then this is for you!</p>
